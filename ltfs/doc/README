LTFS usage
=======================================================================

1.	Build and/or install the LTFS application

	Installation instuctions are in INSTALLING.linux/INSTALLING.macosx
	Information on how to build from source are in BUILDING.linux/BUILDING.macosx/Building.windows 

2.	Ensure that /usr/local/bin/ is in your command search path

	For example:
	$ export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

3.	Format the tape cartridge in LTFS format

	For Linux:
	$ mkltfs -d /dev/st0

	For Mac OS X:
	$ mkltfs -d 0
  
	Usage: mkltfs <options>

Available options are:
  -d, --device=<name>       Tape device (required)
  -f, --force               Force to format medium
  -s, --tape-serial=<id>    Tape serial number (6 alphanumeric ASCII characters)
  -n, --volume-name=<name>  Tape volume name (LTFS VOLUME by default)
  -r, --rules=<rules>       Rules for choosing files to write to the index partition.
                            The syntax of the rule argument is:
                                size=1M
                                size=1M/name=pattern
                                size=1M/name=pattern1:pattern2:pattern3
                            A file is written to the index partition if it is no larger
                            than the given size AND matches at least one of the name
                            patterns (if specified). The size argument accepts K, M, and G
                            suffixes. Name patterns might contain the special characters
                            '?' (match any single character) and '*' (match zero or more
                            characters).
      --no-override         Disallow mount-time data placement policy changes
  -w, --wipe                Restore the LTFS medium to an unpartitioned medium (format to a legacy scratch medium)
  -q, --quiet               Suppress progress information and general messages
  -t, --trace               Enable function call tracing
      --syslogtrace         Enable diagnostic output to stderr and syslog
  -V, --version             Version information
  -h, --help                This help
  -p, --advanced-help       Full help, including advanced options
  -g, --interactive         Interactive mode
  -i, --config=<file>       Use the specified configuration file (default: /usr/local/etc/ltfs.conf)
  -e, --backend=<name>      Use the specified tape device backend (default: ltotape)
  -b, --blocksize=<num>     Set the LTFS record size (default: 524288)
  -c, --no-compression      Disable compression on the volume
  -k, --keep-capacity       Keep the tape medium's total capacity proportion
  -x, --fulltrace           Enable full function call tracing (slow)
      --long-wipe           Unformat the medium and erase any data on the tape by overwriting special data pattern.
                            This operation takes over 3 hours. Once you start, you cannot interrupt it.

LTOTAPE backend options:

	-o log_directory=<dir>    log snapshot directory (default=/var/log)
	-o nosizelimit            remove 512kB limit (NOT RECOMMENDED)

5.	Write files to the LTFS volume
	For example:
	$ cp -RL /home/user1  /mnt/lto5/

6.	Unmount the tape cartridge
	This flushes the data buffer of the file system to the tape cartridge,
	and prepares for eject.

	$ umount /mnt/lto5
		OR
	$ fusermount -u /mnt/lto5  (Linux only)

7.	If at some time in the future user wishes to remove the LTFS format from
	the cartridge so that it can be reused for a different purpose, use
	the unltfs utility.  Note that this will IRRETRIEVABLY DESTROY all
	contents of the cartridge, so use it only when you are sure that you
	wish to erase the LTFS volume.

	$ unltfs -d /dev/st0

	unltfs options:

	Usage: unltfs <options>
	
	-d, --device=<name> specifies the tape drive to use
	-y, --justdoit      omits normal verification steps, reformats without further prompting
	-e  --eject         eject tape after operation completes successfully
	-q, --quiet         suppresses all progress output
	-t, --trace         displays detailed progress
	-h, --help          shows this help
	-i, --config=<file> overrides the default config file
	-b, --backend       specifies a different tape backend subsystem
	-x, --fulltrace     displays debug information (verbose)
	
8.	If the cartridge gets inconsistent due to power failure or improper unmount or incase 
	of any other failures then user can make it consistent again using the ltfsck utility.

	$ ltfsck /dev/st0

	ltfsck options  

	Usage: ltfsck [options] filesys

Important Note:
===============

Earlier versions of the LTFS application supported the original 1.0 LTFS
format specification; version v1.2.0 and later supports the updated 2.0.0 LTFS
format specification.  LTFS volumes created with application v1.2.0 will not
be readable in older versions of the LTFS application, as shown in the
following table:

						Cartridge written by	Cartridge written by	Cartridge written by
LTFS application		v1.1.0 or earlier		v1.2.0 or later			v2.1.0 or later
--------------------  ----------------------  ----------------------  -----------------------
v1.1.0 or earlier		Read/Write ok			Cannot be mounted		N/A

v1.2.0 or later			Readable ok; will		Read/Write ok			N/A
						automatically be 
						converted to new
						format if written

v2.1.0 or later			Readable ok; will		Readable ok; will		Read/Write ok
						automatically be		automatically be 
						converted to new		converted to new
						format if written		format if written
						
It is recommended that all instances of LTFS should be updated to latest version
to avoid these compatibility issues. 

If for some reason it is important to maintain cartridges readable by
previous versions of the LTFS application, care should be taken to avoid
writing to those cartridges with the new version of the application.  This
may be accomplished by mounting the volume as read-only, or by using the
cartridge write-protect tab to prevent cartridge updates.  However this
should be regarded as a temporary measure until all the application instances
can be updated to latest version.

Limitations:
============

	1.	When the tape cartridge is almost full, further write operations will
		be prevented.  The free space on the tape (e.g. from the df command)
		will indicate that there is still some capacity available, but that
		is reserved for updating the index when the tape is unmounted.

	2.	Future mounts of a cartridge that is almost full (has passed the
		point at which "early warning" is reported) will mount as Read Only,
		to prevent further modifications which may not fit on tape.  This 
		status is cleared when a cartridge is reformatted (using mkltfs) or
		when the volume is rolled back erasing history (using ltfsck).

	3.	(Mac OS X)  LTFS does not support moving a folder within LTFS.
		Any attempt to move a folder in such a manner will result in an 
		"operation not permitted" error, and the operation will be ignored.
		The user can still move a file within LTFS, and the user can also move
		a folder from LTFS to non-LTFS file system or vice versa.

	4.	(Mac OS X)  Mac OS X's Spotlight will not display the files 
		on LTFS as a result of search.
